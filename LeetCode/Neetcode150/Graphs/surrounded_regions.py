# thoughts
# - Concept: Reverse thinking. There are always 2 ways of specifying what you want.
#   1. "Only A"
#   2. "Everything except (NOT A)"
# - Turn "I only want to flip surrounding regions" into "I want to flip every region except
#   the non-surrounded (i.e. border) regions"
# - Now all you have to do is mark the border regions and blindly mark everything else as an 'X'

# Ok this is a lot nicer, but worst case space complexity is O(n) (when graph is dimension 1xn, the
