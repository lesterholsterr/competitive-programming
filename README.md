# competitive-programming

I am starting my "competitive programming" journey later than many of my peers, but as the old adage goes, better late than never.

Currently, I am following Neetcode's [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) of 150 questions, as I am focused on coding interview prep rather than contests.

Most of my solutions are written in Python, although I hope to solve some problems in C++ in the future.

I have also uploaded some files that I'm learning with so you can watch me not understand pointers :D
