# competitive-programming

I am starting my competitive programming journey later than many of my peers, but as the old adage goes, better late than never. 

My aim is to complete 2 LeetCode questions a night, in either Python or C++. I typically try to code a solution myself, then read some solutions and code a new, more efficient solution. For your own sanity, only this second version is pushed to this repo (trust me, you don't want to see my original 1000 line O(n!!!!) solutions).

I also uploaded some files that I'm learning with so you can watch me struggle with C++ pointers :D
