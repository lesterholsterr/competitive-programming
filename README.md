# competitive-programming

I am starting my competitive programming journey later than many of my peers, but as the old adage goes, better late than never. 

My aim is to complete 1-2 LeetCode questions a night, 4 nights a week. Currently, I am following Neetcode's [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) of 150 questions

I will try to show my initial attempt, Neetcode's solution, and my takeaways from the question. Most of my solutions are written in Python, although I am learning C++ and hope to solve some problems in C++ in the future.

I have also uploaded some files that I'm learning with so you can watch me not understand pointers :D
